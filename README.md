Source code can be accessed at [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/petra-vozarova/interactive-markdown),
or you can see deployed [Interactive Markdown application](https://petra-vozarova.github.io/interactive-markdown/) in action.

## Introduction

This web-application allows a user to interact with the editor element and  to observe any changes to be instantly rendered in the preview box.

## Functionality

### Editor Box
This element contains default text that updates the state of the app when the page is loaded. The text benefits from various markdown functionalities and features to convey presented information, remote resources or visual data in organised and eye-catching form. 

The state of the app is automatically updated when the user makes any changes in the editor box.

### Preview Box
This element receives all data about the state of the app and renders markdown script. 

If any changes are performed in the editor box, the preview box responds to them by adjusting the displayed data accordingly.

### Responsive Web Design
Dimensions of the app are automatically adjusted depending on the device's screen size to provide the best possible experience.
